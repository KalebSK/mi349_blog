            <h2>Kaleb Koebel</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Kaleb and I am a senior computer science major at Michigan State University.
                I grew up in a small town called Stevensville Michigan which is along Lake Michigan and the southwest corner of the state.
                I am a complete computer nerd and have been using computers since I was 2 years old. My hobbies include:

            <ul class="hobbies">
                <li><p>video games</p></li>
                <li><p>guitar playing</p></li>
                <li><p>coding</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>I also love animals especially dogs and was raised around horses, ducks, chickens, rabbits and many more. After graduating from college,
                I plan to get a job as a software developer at a good company, travel the world some and eventually start a family.
